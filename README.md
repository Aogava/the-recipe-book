FRONT-END PART:

Run "cd .\recipe-front-end\" to move to front-end folder, if you are not currently there.
Run "npm install".
Run "npm run dev -- --host" in console while being in "recipe-front-end" folder.

No time for that now, but for future.

Bugs to fix:

- Filter doesn't apply automatically when clicking on country or ingredient in RecipeInfoPage. (To apply it, user have to manually click on search button)

To impove:

- Add list of available options when user typing in inputs fields for filters.

BACK-END PART:

Run "cd .\recipe-back-end\" to move to back-end folder, if you are not currently there.
Run "npm install".
Run "node index.js" in console while being in "recipe-back-end" folder.

Bugs to fix:

- Didn't see any.

To impove:

- Add more errors handling.
